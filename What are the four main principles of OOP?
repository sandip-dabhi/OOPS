What are the four main principles of OOP? 
 Encapsulation → bundling data and methods together, hiding internal details.
 Inheritance → deriving new classes from existing ones to reuse code.
 Polymorphism → same method name behaves differently based on the object.
 Abstraction → exposing only essential features, hiding complexities.
