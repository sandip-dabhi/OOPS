 What is the Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface?
An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods.
An interface has only abstract methods.

=============Example with abstract class:==================

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();  // Abstract method

    void info() {          // Concrete method
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle();
        s.draw();   // Output: Drawing a circle.
        s.info();   // Output: This is a shape.
    }
}
