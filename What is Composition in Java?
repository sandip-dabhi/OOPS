What is Composition in Java?
Composition is a design principle in OOP where one class contains an object of another class and delegates responsibilities to the included object.

It's a "has-a" relationship and is stronger than aggregation â€” the composed object cannot exist independently of the parent.

===================Example================

class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    Car() {
        engine = new Engine();  // Composition: Engine is part of Car
    }

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.drive();
    }
}
