What is Association in OOP?
Association represents a relationship between two separate classes that are established through their objects.
Types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many.

class Teacher {
    String name;
    Teacher(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Department {
    String deptName;
    Teacher teacher;

    Department(String deptName, Teacher teacher) {
        this.deptName = deptName;
        this.teacher = teacher;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Teacher t = new Teacher("Dr. Smith");
        Department d = new Department("Physics", t);
        System.out.println(d.teacher.name);  // Output: Dr. Smith
    }
}
