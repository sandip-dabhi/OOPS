What is Composition in OOP?
Composition means a class contains references to other objects to reuse their functionality.

=======Example:===============

class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started.");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    Car() {
        engine = new Engine();  // Composing Engine inside Car
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}
