What is Aggregation in Java?
Aggregation is a form of association that represents a "has-a" relationship, but with loose coupling. The contained object can exist independently of the container object.

=========Example:===============

class Address {
    String city;
    Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class Student {
    String name;
    Address address;

    Student(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address addr = new Address("Mumbai");
        Student s = new Student("Ravi", addr);
        System.out.println(s.name + " lives in " + s.address.city);
    }
}
