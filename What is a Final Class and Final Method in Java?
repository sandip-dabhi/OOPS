What is a Final Class and Final Method in Java?
A final class cannot be extended (i.e., no subclassing).

A final method cannot be overridden.

=========Example:==============

final class Vehicle {
    final void run() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is running");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        v.run();  // Output: Vehicle is running
    }
}
