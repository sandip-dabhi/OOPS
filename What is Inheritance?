What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is the OOP concept where one class (child or subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (parent or superclass).

It allows:
Code reuse (no need to rewrite common code).
Establishing “is-a” relationships (e.g., a Dog is a type of Animal).

===================== Key Features of Inheritance:===========================
Reuse existing code from parent classes.
Extend or override parent behavior in child classes.
Create a hierarchical structure between classes.

===============================Basic Syntax in Java:============================

class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        d.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}


========== Advantages of Inheritance==================
 Code Reuse → avoid duplicating shared logic.
 Extensibility → add new features by extending existing classes.
 Maintainability → update the parent class, and changes reflect in child classes.
