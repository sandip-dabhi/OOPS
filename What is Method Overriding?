What is Method Overriding?
 Method Overriding happens when a child class provides its own version of a method already defined in the parent class.
It is a type of runtime polymorphism.
================ Example:==============

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();  // calls Dog's overridden sound() method
    }
}
